# DatapackLoader

DatapackLoader is a Spigot / Paper plugin that automatically adds datapacks into your server! This plugin is intended as a tool to quicken datapack development, but it can also be used to install datapacks.

There are four options for adding datapacks:

    - Dragging and dropping by hand into the plugin's 'Datapacks' folder.
    - Pasting a URL into the '/dl import <url>' console command.
    - Pasting URLs into 'config.yml'.
    - Enabling 'starter-datapack' in 'config.yml'.


Command | Permission | Description:

    - /dl help | datapackloader.help | Describes how to use the plugin.
    - /dl import <url> | (console only) | Imports a datapack from a .zip URL.
    - /dltp <worldname> | datapackloader.tp | Teleport to the given world's spawn with spectator mode.
