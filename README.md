# DatapackLoader

DatapackLoader is a Spigot / Paper plugin that allows you to automatically add datapacks into your server's world. This plugin is intended as a tool to quicken datapack development, but it can also be used as a helper for those new to using datapacks.

There are four different methods of getting datapacks into the 'Datapacks' folder:
  - Dragging and dropping by hand.
  - Pasting file URLs into 'config.yml'.
  - Enabling 'starter-datapack' in 'config.yml'.
  - Pasting a URL into the '/dl import [url]' console command.

Command | Permission | Description:
  - /dl help | datapackloader.help | Describes how to use the plugin.
  - /dl import [url] | (console only) | Imports a datapack from a .zip URL.
  - /dltp [worldname] | datapackloader.tp | Teleport to the given world's spawn with spectator mode.

A "README.txt" in this plugin's folder will generate with additional information.
